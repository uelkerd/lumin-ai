> Entry-level friendly AI project analyzing democratic governance through neural networks, combining cutting-edge technology with real-world social impact.

## 🌱 Project Overview

LUMIN.AI leverages machine learning to enhance democratic transparency by analyzing governance data from Austria's Democracy Radar surveys and blockchain governance systems. 

Our MVP-first approach ensures meaningful deliverables while building towards advanced AI-powered policy insights.

### 🎯 Mission
Transform complex governance data into actionable insights that strengthen democratic participation and transparency.

### 🗝️ Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Neural networks analyzing public perception of governance
- **Trust Correlation**: Statistical analysis linking transparency to public trust
