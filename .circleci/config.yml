# CircleCI configuration for LUMIN.AI with linting, testing, and coverage reporting
# This configuration focuses on code quality and test coverage reporting to Codecov

version: 2.1

# Using the latest version of the Python and Codecov orbs
orbs:
  python: circleci/python@2.0.1
  codecov: codecov/codecov@4.0.1

# Define jobs for linting, testing, and coverage reporting
jobs:
  lint-python-code:
    # Use the default Python executor - this gives us a clean Linux environment with Python pre-installed
    executor: python/default

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get your code from the repository
      # This downloads all your project files so CircleCI can examine them
      - checkout

      # Step 2: Install Ruff
      # We install Ruff directly rather than from requirements.txt to keep things simple and fast
      # This ensures we always get the latest version and don't depend on your project dependencies
      - run:
          name: "Install Ruff linter"
          command: |
            echo "Installing Ruff - the lightning-fast Python linter..."
            pip install ruff==0.4.4

            # Show which version we installed for debugging purposes
            echo "Ruff version installed:"
            ruff --version

      # Step 3: Run Ruff across your entire Python codebase
      # This will check all Python files in your project for style and quality issues
      - run:
          name: "Lint Python code with Ruff"
          command: |
            echo "Running Ruff linter across the entire LUMIN.AI codebase..."
            echo "This will check for style issues, unused imports, and potential bugs..."

            # Run Ruff on the entire project
            # The '.' means "check everything in the current directory and subdirectories"
            # --output-format=github makes the output more readable in CircleCI
            ruff check . --output-format=github

            echo "Ruff linting completed successfully!"

      # Step 4: Check code formatting with Ruff
      # This verifies that your code follows consistent formatting standards
      # Running this separately makes it clear what type of issue needs fixing
      - run:
          name: "Check Python code formatting"
          command: |
            echo "Checking if Python code follows consistent formatting..."

            # Use Ruff's formatter to check if code is properly formatted
            # --check means "don't fix anything, just tell me if there are issues"
            # --diff shows exactly what would change if we ran the formatter
            ruff format --check --diff .

            echo "Code formatting check completed!"

      # Step 5: Generate a summary report
      # This gives you a nice overview of what was checked and any issues found
      - run:
          name: "Generate linting summary"
          command: |
            echo "=== LINTING SUMMARY FOR LUMIN.AI ==="
            echo "Directories checked:"
            find . -name "*.py" -type f | head -10 | sed 's|^./||'
            if [ $(find . -name "*.py" -type f | wc -l) -gt 10 ]; then
              echo "... and $(expr $(find . -name "*.py" -type f | wc -l) - 10) more Python files"
            fi

            echo ""
            echo "Total Python files scanned: $(find . -name "*.py" -type f | wc -l)"

# Define the workflows that determine when jobs run
workflows:

  # Linting workflow
  lint:
    jobs:

  # Testing and coverage workflow
  test-and-coverage:
    jobs:

      # Removed the separate codecov/upload job since we're now uploading directly from the run-python-tests job

# Optional: You can also set up the workflow to run on pull requests only
# This is useful if you want to save CircleCI credits by not running on every small commit
# Uncomment the section below and comment out the section above if you prefer this approach

# workflows:
#   version: 2
#   lint-on-pull-request:
#     jobs:
#       - lint-python-code:
#           filters:
#             branches:
#               ignore: main  # Don't run on main branch pushes
#             pull_requests:
#               only: /.*/    # Run on all pull requests
