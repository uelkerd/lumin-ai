# Backend PRD Requirements Analysis

## Core Backend Components Missing from Current PRD

### 1. API Design & Architecture

**Missing Requirements:**

- RESTful API endpoint specifications
- Data schema definitions and validation
- Request/response formats and error codes
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Rate limiting and security policies
- API versioning strategy

### 2. Data Management & Processing

**Missing Requirements:**

- Database design and schema management
- Data ingestion pipelines from Data Science/Deep Learning tracks
- Real-time data processing requirements
- Data caching and storage optimization
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Data retention and archival policies

### 3. Integration Services

**Missing Requirements:**

- Message queuing and event processing
- Inter-service communication protocols
- Data synchronization between tracks
- Webhook and notification systems
- Third-party service integrations
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

### 4. Performance & Scalability

**Missing Requirements:**

- Server performance benchmarks
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies (Redis, etc.)
- Load balancing and auto-scaling
- Resource monitoring and alerting
- Deployment and CI/CD pipelines

### 5. Security & Compliance

**Missing Requirements:**

- Authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- API security and input validation
- GDPR compliance for governance data
- Audit logging and compliance reporting
- Penetration testing requirements

## Recommended Document Structure

### Frontend PRD (WebDev-Frontend-PRD.md)

- User interface requirements
- Component specifications
- User experience workflows
- Frontend performance requirements
- Browser compatibility
- Accessibility compliance
- API consumption patterns

### Backend PRD (WebDev-Backend-PRD.md)

- API design and endpoints
- Database architecture
- Data processing pipelines
- Integration services
- Security and authentication
- Performance and scalability
- Deployment and infrastructure

## Benefits of Separation

### 1. **Clarity of Responsibilities**

- Frontend team focuses on user experience
- Backend team focuses on data services
- Clear interface contracts between teams

### 2. **Independent Development**

- Teams can work in parallel
- Separate testing and validation
- Independent deployment cycles

### 3. **Stakeholder Communication**

- UX designers work with frontend PRD
- Data scientists work with backend PRD
- Infrastructure team uses backend PRD

### 4. **Maintenance and Updates**

- Easier to update specific requirements
- Clearer change management
- Better version control

## Integration Points to Document

### API Contracts

- Data Science track integration endpoints
- Deep Learning track sentiment analysis APIs
- Real-time data streaming requirements
- Error handling and fallback procedures

### Data Flow Architecture

- How data flows from analytical tracks to frontend
- Caching and performance optimization
- Real-time vs. batch processing requirements
- Data consistency and validation

### Security Integration

- Authentication flow between frontend and backend
- Authorization for different user types
- Data privacy and governance compliance
- API security and rate limiting
