    "title": "Address Frontend Dependencies: Deprecated Packages and Vulnerabilities",
    "body": "During a recent environment verification, `npm install` for the `web-development/frontend` directory revealed several issues:\n\n- **Deprecated Packages:** Numerous packages are outdated and no longer supported. See `npm install` logs for the full list.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** `npm audit` reported 9 vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 6 high).\n\nWhile these are not currently blocking development, we should address them to maintain project health and security.\n\n**Tasks:**\n1. Investigate the 9 vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit`.\n2. Run `npm audit fix` to attempt automatic resolution.\n3. If `npm audit fix` doesn't resolve all issues, manually update packages or find alternatives.\n4. Address the warnings for deprecated packages by updating them to newer versions.\n5. Ensure all tests pass after updating dependencies.\n\nThis is a technical debt task that should be prioritized in an upcoming sprint.",
