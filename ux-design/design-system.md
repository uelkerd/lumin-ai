# Lumin AI Dashboard Design System

## Introduction

This design system outlines the core principles, guidelines, and components for building the Lumin AI dashboard. Our goal is to create a modern, high-tech interface with a soft yet bold aesthetic, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience.

## Color Palette

The color palette utilizes dark shades of purple, blue, and black to create a sophisticated and vibrant gradient. This gradient will be used subtly in backgrounds, key graphical elements, and interactive states to convey a sense of depth and modernity.

- **Primary Gradient:** A smooth transition from deep black (#0A0A0A) to a rich dark blue (#1A237E) and finally to a deep, velvety purple (#4A148C).
- **Accent Colors:**
    - A vibrant electric blue (#29B6F6) for calls to action and key highlights.
    - A subtle silver-grey (#B0BEC5) for secondary text and inactive elements.
- **Neutral Colors:**
    - Pure Black (#000000) for backgrounds and deep shadows.
    - Off-White (#F5F5F5) for text on dark backgrounds and subtle dividers.

## Typography

We will use a modern, sans-serif typeface that is highly legible on screens. The typography should reflect the high-tech nature of the application while maintaining a soft feel.

- **Primary Font:** [Choose a suitable modern sans-serif font, e.g., 'Roboto', 'Montserrat', 'Inter']
- **Font Weights:** Use a range of weights (e.g., Light, Regular, Medium, Bold) to create visual hierarchy.
- **Sizing Scale:** Establish a consistent typographic scale for headings, subheadings, body text, and captions.
    - H1: [Size]
    - H2: [Size]
    - H3: [Size]
    - Body: [Size]
    - Caption: [Size]

## Standardized Components

A library of reusable UI components will be developed to ensure consistency and speed up development. Each component should adhere to the defined color palette, typography, and interaction patterns.

- **Buttons:** Define primary, secondary, and tertiary button styles with clear hover and active states.
- **Forms:** Standardize input fields, text areas, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns. Include validation states.
- **Navigation Elements:** Define styles for navigation bars, tabs, and links.
- **Cards and Panels:** Establish styles for containing content and data visualizations.
- **Data Visualizations:** Provide guidelines for charts, graphs, and tables, ensuring they integrate seamlessly with the color palette and typography.
- **Icons:** Use a consistent icon set that aligns with the aesthetic.

## Interaction Patterns

Define how users interact with the dashboard elements to ensure a predictable and intuitive experience.

- **Hover Effects:** Subtle visual feedback on interactive elements.
- **Click and Tap Feedback:** Clear visual confirmation of user actions.
- **Transitions and Animations:** Use subtle and purposeful transitions to guide the user's eye and enhance the sense of polish. Avoid overly flashy or distracting animations.
- **State Management:** Clearly define states for elements (e.g., active, inactive, disabled, error, success).
- **Responsiveness:** Design components to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
