# Accessibility Features for Lumin AI Dashboard (WCAG 2.1 Compliance)

This document outlines the key accessibility features to be implemented in the Lumin AI dashboard to ensure compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, targeting Level AA conformance.

## 1. Perceivable

### Screen Reader Compatibility:
- **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`, etc.) to structure content logically.
- **ARIA Attributes:** Implement WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties to provide additional information and context for screen readers, especially for dynamic content and custom interactive elements.
- **Meaningful Alternative Text:** Provide descriptive `alt` text for all non-text content (images, charts, icons) that conveys the purpose and content of the visual element.
- **Captions and Transcripts:** Provide captions for all pre-recorded audio and video content. Offer transcripts for audio content.

### Adaptable:
- **Content Structure:** Ensure content is structured so that it can be presented in different ways without losing information or structure (e.g., simpler layout without CSS, different screen sizes).
- **Orientation:** Content should not be restricted to a single display orientation (e.g., portrait or landscape) unless essential.

### Distinguishable:
- **Color Contrast:** Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text, graphical objects, and user interface components. Provide a mechanism for users to adjust contrast if needed.
- **Color Alone:** Do not rely solely on color to convey information. Use alternative means like text labels, icons, or patterns.
- **Audio Control:** Provide controls to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content.

## 2. Operable

### Keyboard Accessible:
- **Full Keyboard Support:** All interactive elements should be focusable and operable using a keyboard alone.
- **Focus Indicator:** Provide a clear and visible focus indicator to show users which element is currently selected.
- **No Keyboard Traps:** Users should be able to navigate away from any element using only the keyboard.

### Enough Time:
- **Timing Adjustable:** For time-sensitive content, provide options to extend, adjust, or turn off time limits.
- **Pause, Stop, Hide:** Allow users to pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content.

### Seizures and Physical Reactions:
- **Three Flashes or Below Threshold:** Avoid content that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or use techniques that stay below the general flash and red flash thresholds.

### Navigable:
- **Skip Links:** Include a "Skip to main content" link at the beginning of each page to allow users to bypass repetitive navigation.
- **Clear Headings and Labels:** Use clear and descriptive headings to organize content and labels for form fields and interactive elements.
- **Focus Order:** Ensure the tab order is logical and follows the visual layout of the page.
- **Multiple Ways:** Provide multiple ways to find pages within the dashboard (e.g., sitemap, search functionality, consistent navigation).

## 3. Understandable

### Readable:
- **Language Identification:** Specify the primary human language of each page and any changes in language within the content.
- **Unusual Words:** Provide mechanisms to understand unusual words or phrases (e.g., definitions, glossaries).
- **Abbreviations:** Explain abbreviations on their first use or provide a mechanism for users to understand them.
- **Reading Level:** Aim for a reading level that is understandable to a broader audience where appropriate.

### Predictable:
- **Consistent Navigation:** Maintain consistent navigation across all pages of the dashboard.
- **Consistent Identification:** Components with the same functionality across the dashboard should be identified consistently.
- **Change on Request:** Changes in the state of the user interface should not occur automatically without user initiation, unless a mechanism is provided to turn this off.

### Input Assistance:
- **Error Identification:** Identify input errors and describe them to the user in text.
- **Labels or Instructions:** Provide labels or instructions for all form fields and interactive elements.
- **Error Prevention:** For submissions that result in legal commitments, financial transactions, or data alteration, provide a mechanism for reviewing, correcting, or confirming information before final submission.

## 4. Robust

### Compatible:
- **Parsing:** Ensure that content can be reliably interpreted by a wide range of user agents, including assistive technologies.
- **Name, Role, Value:** For all user interface components, the name, role, and value should be programmatically determinable and notifications of changes to these items should be available to user agents, including assistive technologies.

By implementing these accessibility features, the Lumin AI dashboard will be more usable and accessible to a wider range of users, including those with disabilities, contributing to a more inclusive user experience.
