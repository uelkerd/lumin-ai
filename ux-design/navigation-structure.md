# Lumin AI Dashboard Navigation Structure

This document outlines the navigation structure for the Lumin AI dashboard, focusing on a logical flow and ease of access to key features.

## Main Sections

The dashboard is divided into the following main sections:

*   **Dashboard Overview:** This is the landing page, providing a high-level summary of key metrics and recent activity.
*   **Data Analysis:** This section allows users to delve deeper into specific datasets, apply filters, and generate reports.
*   **Trust Metrics:** Dedicated section for exploring the trust metrics, including time-series data and demographic analysis.
*   **Settings:** User preferences, account management, and configuration options.
*   **Help/Support:** Access to documentation, tutorials, and support resources.

## Navigation Flow

Users will primarily navigate the dashboard through a persistent sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen.

*   **Sidebar:** The sidebar will contain the main navigation links to each of the sections listed above. The current active section will be clearly highlighted.
*   **Sub-navigation:** Within sections like "Data Analysis" and "Trust Metrics," sub-navigation (potentially as tabs or a secondary menu) will allow users to access specific tools or views within that section.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** Breadcrumbs will be used at the top of the content area to indicate the user's current location within the dashboard hierarchy.
*   **Action Buttons:** Key actions within each section (e.g., "Analyze Data," "Generate Report") will be presented as prominent buttons within the content area.
*   **Search:** A global search bar will be available in the header to quickly find specific data, reports, or settings.

## User Movement

*   **Primary Navigation:** Users will move between the main sections by clicking on the links in the sidebar.
*   **Secondary Navigation:** Within sections, users will utilize sub-navigation elements (tabs, secondary menus) to switch between different tools or views.
*   **Drill-down:** Clicking on elements within charts or tables may lead to a more detailed view or filtered dataset. Breadcrumbs will allow users to easily return to the previous view.
*   **Contextual Links:** Relevant links to related sections or actions may be provided within the content area to facilitate intuitive navigation.
*   **Help Access:** A persistent help icon or link will provide immediate access to the Help/Support section or contextual help elements like tooltips.

This navigation structure aims to be intuitive and efficient, allowing users to easily access the information and tools they need within the Lumin AI dashboard.
