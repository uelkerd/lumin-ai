## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/uelkerd/lumin-ai/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/uelkerd/lumin-ai/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to coordinate our efforts and prevent duplication of work.

### Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2.  Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3.  Increase the version numbers in any examples and the `README.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4.  You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
